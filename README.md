- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jbonitatibus12 -- Joseph Bonitatibus (he / him), a Senior of Computer Science at Georgia Tech.
- Iâ€™m interested in developing video games in Unity and Unreal (looking to learn Unreal Engine 5), and creating functional, attractive UIs for my applications.
- I've worked on a game for both the '23 and '24 GMTK Game Jam, and those games can be found <a href = "https://will-parker.itch.io/pit-boss/devlog/561528/post-jam-release">here</a> and <a href="https://will-parker.itch.io/terror-in-toyland">here</a>. I also worked on a game thorugh my school, LightDiskVR, which can be found <a href="https://www.gtvgdev.com/games-archive/light-disk-vr">here</a>!
- I have experience with Java, Python, C#, and C, and I'm also learning C++ and JavaScript right now. I have worked on lots of projects using computer graphics, computer audio and some computer vision. I am also learning Japanese  at roughly an N3 level and going to take the certification exam next Summer!
